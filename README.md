I created a dynamic Django website centered around food,
leveraging Python for back-end functionality and PostgreSQL for
robust data storage. Key features include secure payment
processing with OTP verification, seamless user authentication, and
advanced capabilities like downloading data in Excel and PDF
formats. The front-end, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
ensures a user-friendly interface with responsive design. This
project exemplifies efficient integration of technology to deliver a
secure, engaging, and functional food-centric platform.
